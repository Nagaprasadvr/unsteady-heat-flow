This project tries to solve the unsteady diffusion heat equation by numerical methods such as finite difference method , trying to find the approximation for a continous field function . The distribution of heat on a square domain can be found or recorded at any time stamp given boundary conditions,to view this distribution a contour plot is plotted with gnuplot which depicts the intensity of heat at any time stamp.

The boundary conditions are as follows: 40 degrees inside a circle of radius 0.44 and centre (0.5,0.5) on a square grid of [0,1]*[0,1] at time t=0.And 20 degrees on the remaining area.Throughout the boudary the temperature remains constant with 20 degrees.
